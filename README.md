#My Portfolio Page

##Overview
This is my portfolio website for my Udacity course.  The first two projects are linked to the git repositories.  The last one is a "dummy" repository and I will update this README and fill this out once I finish the project.

##Installation
Download the entire directory into your project folder.  Open the index.html file in your browser.
